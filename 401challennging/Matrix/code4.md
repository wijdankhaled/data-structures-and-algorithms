<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

algothmic 
1. creat afunction that take matrix 
2. creat empty array
3. declration a value to sum each array 
4. looping around the matrix the external array
4. assigne zero to vlaue of sum 
5. looping around the matrix theinternail arrays
6. in each itrate add to value sum the index value from the xternal loop and the internal loop
7. after looping push the value of sum in the new array
